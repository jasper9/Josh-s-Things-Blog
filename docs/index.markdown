I used to create content on a blog I loving called `Josh as a Service` where I documented various zany projects such as `Dinner as a Service` which demonstrated integration points in VMware VCAC/VRA/Aria to external API's by using a Raspberry PI & Arduino and a Sous Vide cooker.  To make food.  It was awesome. 

Since then I moved on to [various](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivotal_Software) [other](https://cloud.google.com/) [roles](https://www.tiaa.org/). A pandemic happened. I spent more time on [bikes](https://www.strava.com/athletes/9266).  My town [burned down](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYRsndTJViM/). [Traveled](https://www.instagram.com/p/C5Ujxk7SvVe/?img_index=1) a bunch.

Fast forward a bit and tech looks quite a [bit different now](https://investors.broadcom.com/news-releases/news-release-details/broadcom-completes-acquisition-vmware). What I [used to do](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/server-virtualization) is less of a thing, and [other things](https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/strategic-cloud-platform-services) are much more popular. So here we are. Let's learn some new things together.

Just a collection of my things. See my [profile](http://www.joshsthings.com/) here.
